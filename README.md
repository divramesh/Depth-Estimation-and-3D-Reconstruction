Source codes submitted to Instructor Prof. Gerard Medioni for CSCI 576 class project at USC

These codes are a part of the class project on Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction. The project was carried out in two parts - the first part was estimation of depth by computing disparity from speckle patterned images produced by Kinect sensor. The second part of the project involved the calibration of the depth and color sensors of  Kinect to generate point cloud images of objects in the scene captured by them. 

The file named Disparith_Depth_Estimation is the source code for the first part and Sensors_Calibration is the source code for the second part. Both the parts use the OpenCV 2.4.8 library in C++. 

The data for code evaluation is available on request.
